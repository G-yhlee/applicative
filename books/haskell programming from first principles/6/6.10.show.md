Showis a typeclass that provides for the creating of human- readable string representations of structured data. GHCi uses Showto createStringvalues it can print in the terminal. Showis not a serialization format. Serialization is how data is rendered to a textual or binary format for persistence or communicating with other computers over a network. An example of persistence would be saving data to a file on disk. Showis not suitable for any of these purposes; itâ€™s expressly for human readability.

```hs
class Show a where
showsPrec :: Int -> a -> ShowS show :: a -> String
showList :: [a] -> ShowS
instance Show a => Show [a]
instance Show Ordering
instance Show a => Show (Maybe a)
instance Show Integer
